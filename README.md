# Anything that happens to your hardware is not my responsibility as you have agreed to since you decided to run a stranger batch file (program) without reading the source code/readme

****The batch file (program) is readable even to NEWBIES (who have never touch a code in their life)****

## This is a batch file (program) that allows you to tune windows without the knowledge to do so; It allows you to debloat your windows & drivers.

**In order to find what the code does you can simply download the file, right click the batch file (program), and click "Edit" on the windows context menu; If the windows context menu does not show "Edit", simply look for "Open With", and select your notepad (notepad++ or any other notepad that you use)**
