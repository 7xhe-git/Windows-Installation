# Disclaimer

## I am not knowledgeable about Computer (Hardwware/OS)

# Anything that happens to your hardware is not my responsibility as you have agreed to since you decided to run a stranger batch file (program)

# Source Code
**In order to find what the code does you can simply download the file, right click the batch file (program), and click "Edit" on the windows context menu; If the windows context menu does not show "Edit", simply look for "Open With", and select your notepad (notepad++ or any other notepad that you use)**

# Warnings

- **Running this file will change system settings**
- **Windows features such as updates or Defender are disabled**
- **Some drivers may behave differently after debloating**
- **Results may vary depending on your Windows version and hardware**
- **WIFI are disabled**
- **I did not test these on any other hardware beside mine, it may cause issue for you**
- **Recommended to run this on a fresh install (no custom os, no your own tweaks unless you know what it does/how to fix it)


**Q: Can I undo the changes?**
*Only if you have a backup or system restore point. Always create one before using this tool*
*My recommendation is that you create another partition to dual boot and mess with it. With that, no data will get lost*

# How to use?
### Install Setup.bat in Releases and double click to run the file. The file will always install the latest version but ensure you download the latest Setup.bat to make sure it installs it properly
