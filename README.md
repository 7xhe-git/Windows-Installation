# Disclaimer

## I am not knowledgeable about Computer (Hardwware/OS)

# Anything that happens to your hardware is not my responsibility as you have agreed to since you decided to run a stranger batch file (program) without reading the source code/readme

****The batch file (program) is readable even to NEWBIES****

**This is a batch file (program) that allows you to tune windows without the knowledge to do so; It allows you to debloat your windows & drivers.**

**In order to find what the code does you can simply download the file, right click the batch file (program), and click "Edit" on the windows context menu; If the windows context menu does not show "Edit", simply look for "Open With", and select your notepad (notepad++ or any other notepad that you use)**

*The batch file (program) uses windows software such as Registry,CMD (BCDEDIT,FSUTIL,POWERSHELL,REGISTRY). It may also be flagged as a threat to your computer anti-virus since It modifiers various things in your windows including Windows Defender,Windows Update, and Telemetry*

# Warnings

- **Running this file will change system settings**
- **Windows features such as updates or Defender are disabled**
- **Some drivers may behave differently after debloating**
- **Results may vary depending on your Windows version and hardware**

**Q: Can I undo the changes?**
*Only if you have a backup or system restore point. Always create one before using this tool*
*My recommendation is that you create another partition to dual boot and mess with it. With that, no data will get lost*

# How to use?
### Install Setup.bat in Releases and double click to run the file. The file will always install the latest version but ensure you download the latest Setup.bat to make sure it installs it properly
